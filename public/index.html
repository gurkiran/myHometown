                 <p>The city was founded in 1465 CE by Raja Ram Deo, a Bhati Rajput, during the reign of Bahlul Lodi ona piece of land given by Tatar Khan who was the Governor of Lahore Later, during the Mughal rule, Akbar gave it in jagir to his foster brother, Shamsher Khan. The city grew and developed under him.Batala was a very famous city of the Punjab region, just like Lahore, Jalandhar and other major cities in the 16th century,and it is 109 years older than Amritsar. The whole city was lying within a fort. It had 12 gates as entrances and exit. Some of them still survive       although their condition is in need of attention. In 1947, at the time of India's partition, Batala was included in Pakistan. But later Indian leaders realized that in this way the nearby major city of Amritsar would be surrounded by Pakistan on two sides. To avoid this danger to Amritsar, Batala was negotiated back to India from the British. For a total of 3 days, Batala was part of Pakistan, then added to Indian territory. During the political integration of India, Batala was included in the Punjab state       </p>
